# elan-spi-fingerprint

Reverse engineering the SPI elantech fingerprint sensor drivers.

A Ghidra archive of the Wbf driver is present as elanfp.gar. Some notes about the protocol are present in notes.txt

The `proto/` subfolder contains a prototype that tries to connect to a fingerprint sensor and do stuff with it. It's purpose is highly volatile.
